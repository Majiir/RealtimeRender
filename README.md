RealtimeRender
==============

A [Bukkit](https://github.com/Bukkit/Bukkit) plugin for generating world maps.
Rendering happens on-the-fly as changes occur, minimizing downtime and
eliminating manual rendering or specialized scripts.

"RealtimeRender" is not an entirely accurate name. While rendering does not happen
strictly in real time, maps can be scheduled to update frequently enough (every
few minutes) that the map is never out-of-date.
